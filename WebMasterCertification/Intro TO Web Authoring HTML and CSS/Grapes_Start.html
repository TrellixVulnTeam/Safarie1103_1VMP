<h1 style="padding-top: 250px">Planting grape vines</h1>
<p>For the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grape">grape</a>, the best soil is a light, loamy, dry, limestone soil, with
  a high and warm exposure, especially to the south. the earth should be kept
  well cultivated and free from weeds. The most useful fertilizers for the grape
  are well-rotted barn-yard manure, bone, and lime. For ordinary cultivation
  the best varieties are, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Isabella_(grape)">Isabella</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catawba_%28grape%29">Catawba</a>, Diana, Delaware, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concord_grape">Concord</a>, Clinton,
  and the Rebecca when you have a sheltered situation. Some of the finer foreign
  wine-grapes, of France, Italy, and the Rhine region, may be naturalized with
  success in some parts of the United States; but it is hardly yet determined
  which are best suited for the purpose. <br>
  <br>
  Vines are often either trained against the back wall or on a trellis under
  a glass roof. In the former case the plants are always placed inside the house;
  but in the latter, there are two opinions among practical men, one in favor
  of planting them outside, and the other inside the parapet wall. <br>
  <br>
  Abercrombie says: "Let them be carefully turned out of the pots, reducing
  the balls a little and singling out the matted roots. Then place them in the
  pits, just as deep in the earth as they were before, carefully spreading out
  the abres and filling in with fine sifted earth or with vegetable mould. Settle
  all with a little water, and let them have plenty of free air every day, defending
  them from very severe frost or much wet; which is all the care they will require
tiff they begin to push young shoots. </p>
<h1>Pruning grape vines</h1>
<p>The methods of pruning established vines admit of much diversity, as the plants
  are in different situations. Without reckoning the cutting down of young or
  weak plants alternately to the lowermost summer shoot, which is but a temporary
course, three different systems of pruning are adopted. </p>
<ul>
  <li>The first is applicable
    only to vines out of doors, but it may be transferred to plants in a vinery
    without any capital alteration. In this method one perpendicular leader is
    trained from the stem' at the side of which, to the right and left, the ramifications
    spring. Soon after the growing season has commenced, such rising shoots as
    are either in fruit or fit to be retained, or are eligibly placed for mother-bearers
    next season, are laid in either horizontally, or with a slight diagonal rise
    at something less than a foot distance, measuring from one bearing shoot
    to the next. The rising shoots, intended to form young wood should be taken
    as near the origin of the branch as a good one offers, to allow of cutting
    away, beyond the adopted lateral, a greater quantity of the branch, as it
    becomes old wood; the newsprung laterals, not wanted for one of these two
    objects, are pinched off. The treatment of those retained during the rest
    of the summer thus differs: As the shoots in bearing extend in growth. they
    are kept stopped about two eyes beyond the fruit. The coronate shoots, cultivated
    merely to enlarge the provision of wood, are divested of embryo bunches,
    if they show any, but are trained at full length as they advance during the
    summer, until they reach the allotted bounds. In the winter pruning there
    will thus be a good choice of motherbearers. That nearest the origin of the
    former is retained, and the others on the same branch era cut away; the rest
    of the branch is also taken off so that the old wood may terminate with the
    adopted lateral. The adopted shoot is then shortened to two, three, four,
    or more eyes, according to its place on the vine, its own strength, or the
    strength of the vine. The lower shoots are pruned in the shortest, in order
    to keep the means of always supplying young wood at the bottom of the tree.    </li>
  <li>The second method is to head The natural leader so as to cause it to throw
    out two, three, or more principal shoots; these are trained as leading branches,
    and in The winter-pruning are not reduced, unless to shape them to The limits
    of the house, or unless the plant appears too weak to sustain them at length.
    Laterals from these are cultivated about twelve inches apart, as mother-bearers;
    those in fruit are stopped in summer, and after the fall of the leaf are
    cut into one or two eyes. From the appearance of the motherbearer, thus shortened,
    this is called spur-pruning. </li>
  <li>The third plan seems to flow from taking the
    second as a foundation, in having more than one aspiring leader, and from
    joining the superstructure of the first system immediately to this in reserving
    well-placed shoots to come in as bearing wood. Thus, supposing a stem which
    has been headed to send up four vigorous competing leaders, two are suffered
    to bear fruit and two are divested of such buds as break into clusters, and
    trained to the length of ten, twelve, fifteen feet or more, for mother-bearers,
    which have borne a crop, are cut down to within two eyes of the stool or
    legs, according to the strength of the plant, while the reserved shoots lose
    no more of their tops than is necessary to adjust them to the trellis. </li>
</ul>
<h2>To
  prune Vines to advantage</h2>
<p>In pruning vines leave some new branches every year,
  and take away (if too many) some of the old, which will be of great advantage
  to the tree, and much increase the quantity of fruit. When you trim your vine,
  leave two knots and cut them off the next time, for usually two buds yield
  a bunch of grapes. Vines thus pruned have been known to bear abundantly, whereas
  others that have been cut close to please the eye have been almost barren of
  fruit.</p>
