From my research on the web, I found the following to be the current types of e-commerce systems:

	1.Business-to-Business (B2B)
	2.Business-to-Consumer (B2C 
	3.Consumer-to-Consumer (C2C)
	4.Consumer-to-Business (C2B).
	5.Business-to-Administration (B2A)
	6.Consumer-to-Administration (C2A)
	
Most of the e-commerce sites in existence today  fall under one of these types(the jury is still out as to what other type the 
market demand will uncover next).

All web sites use the underlying technology required to transfer data from one locality to another. The origin of data is 
usually the seller/presenter/provider/... and the destination is typically an entity in need of a product.

It is worth mentioning that there are businesses in these arenas that provid the technology to businesses that are 
players(see below) in each particular arena. For example amazon could deal with a company that provides services 
to facilitate them to sell products to consumers(B2C) and one that does the same for its B2B ventures.

E-Commerce System Type: B2B
---------------------------
As the origin and destination names imply, this system type involves a Business as the provider and a Business as the 
consumer. For example, IBM Corporation makes a deal with Office Depot to provide its empoloyees with office supplied.


WebSite1:Quill.com
WebSiteDescription:Quill.com is owned by Staples.  Staples.com is actually the #2 e-commerce site in the world only surpassed 
by Amazon.com.  While Staples sells about 80% to B2B, the Quill.com site is intentionally built for B2B e-commerce.

This B2B website is really a search engine. The users have to type in what they want and they will be directed to businesses that 
provide them. They reported sales of $3.11  Billion out of the total market size of $9.44 Billion in 2013. However, 
google and amazon are chipping away at that share AND contributing to the huge growth in the market.

E-Commerce System Type:B2C
---------------------------
The most popular and widely know e-commerce type, B2C is way to get products to thhe general public. In this arena, the sky 
is the limit. Well as limited as there are consumers and the goods they need.  

WebSite1:amazon.com
WebSiteDescription:
amazon.com started by selling books! And now, a consumer can type anything in their search field and if amazon doesn't 
have it, it will direct the user to several alternative sites.

WebSite2:bestbuy.com
WebSiteDescription:
Bestbuy was a brick and mortar company up until internet and online shopping became popular. The almost missed the 
boat and went bankrupt but they've shows some resilience as of late. It will be very tough for them to compete with 
amazon as amazon is investing heavily and outright winning the "time from warehouse to the house" battle.
