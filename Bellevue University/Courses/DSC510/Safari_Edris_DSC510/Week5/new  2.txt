I do have a little programming experience in the area of machine learning. We can take a data set(see sample), do a little data mininig on it using tableau and gretl and show the results in the poster. we can then determine the modeling(for churning we could use 'logistic regression' algorithm. we can then go on discussing the model assessment and drawing insights from it. Basically going through a typical project. In the data sample attached, we can predict the 'exited' column. We can also add a new column for "approve/reject loan request", etc.
