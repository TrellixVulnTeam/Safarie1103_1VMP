Tones are intentionally muted--so that kitchen elements seem to blend into the background when not in use. Integrated storage and appliances further help the kitchen \"disappear.\" Top-of-the-line fixtures and appliances in the kitchen--from high-end European manufacturers like Miele, Bosch and Hansgrohe--give each residence a sense of timelessness. In the bathroom, floating vanities, hidden drawers and custom cabinetry by local San Francisco cabinetmaker Sozo Studio add that simple, understated flair.", "Designed around a concept of frames, The Austin's large white rectangles add to the City's skyline from a distance.

The white-clad and glass facade reflect light and make the building pop from the streetscape The three facades that gradually slope up Pine Street give the property a sense of purpose and help anchor this neighborhood that continues to evolve and recreate itself. To live at The Austin is to reside in a new school of thought, one that is open and social, receptive to the conviviality of the neighborhood and the City while offering a cozy cocoon on the inside.

Sleek and chic, this 3,945 sq. ft. home (per graphic artist) is straight out of the pages of an interior design magazine. Through the custom redwood entry door, you are immediately greeted with rich hardwood floors; glass and aluminum hand rails; sleek shadow baseboards; and an incredible experience to come. Up the stairs, on the main level, the living room, dining room, kitchen island, and seating area are open, making the space perfect for entertaining. Highlights include a massive black and crystal white fireplace in the living room; a deck off of the living room for barbecuing; a dramatic light fixture in the dining room; and almost every amenity a kitchen can possess: built-in ovens, a custom floating range, a brilliant mirrored induction cooktop, a dual-basin sink, pull-out pantries, a huge Gaggenau stainless refrigerator, a built-in oven and microwave, and more. The playful mix of white laminate; rich wood; aluminum and steel accents; and a backsplash with glass tiles makes for an extremely crisp and strikingly stylish aesthetic without sacrificing warmth. There is a deck beyond the seating area past the kitchen, perfect for dining outdoors, and stairs leading down to a lush and serene garden. On this floor there is also a beautiful guest bedroom and a full bathroom. A half bathroom also serves as a convenient amenity when entertaining guests. On the second level there are the master suite, a large second bedroom, and another full bathroom. The lush master suite begins with a beautiful deck for outdoor seating and continues past the closets and spacious bedroom to a balcony accessed through two doors with views that overlook the garden and surrounding greenery with a prominent and central view of the Palace of Fine Arts. Several windows bathe the space in natural light. There is a massive master closet with custom built-ins and an island on one side and another walk-in closet across the hall. The choice will be only who has the most shoes and outfits! Attached to the bedroom is a stunning master bathroom with white matching vanities; a state-of the art Toto Japanese toilet; a steam shower with bench seating and with no fewer than 7 spraying locations; and a delicious Victoria and Albert tub with a Golden Gate Bridge and Palace of Fine Arts view, providing a breathtaking experience. On this level there is also a wonderful grand-scale bedroom. Four windows face south and get wonderful light, and one faces the master bedroom's deck. The bathroom across the hall is a study in contemporary design. Back on the lower level, there is direct access to the generous 1-car garage with a redwood door, ample storage closets, a full wet bar, and excellent laundry facilities. Beyond these is a gorgeous guest room or office with doors out to the landscaped garden.
