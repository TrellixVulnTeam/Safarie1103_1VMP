Q:What are the listed known issues of using HTML5 Canvas

The Android browser does not support clipping on HTML5 canvas. See the bug filed here: http://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=21099

Older versions of iOS did not support video as a source for the canvas drawImage(), though it does appear to work as of iOS 8 test case

Limits of toDataURL() for iOS: 
- The maximum size for decoded GIF, PNG, and TIFF images is 3 megapixels for devices with less than 256 MB RAM and 5 megapixels for devices with greater or equal than 256 MB RAM. 
- The maximum size for a canvas element is 3 megapixels for devices with less than 256 MB RAM and 5 megapixels for devices with greater or equal than 256 MB RAM. 
- JavaScript execution time is limited to 10 seconds for each top-level entry point.

In IE 11 canvas.toDataURL() does not work if the canvas has images with data URI sources see bug

IE 10 canvas doesn't support setLineDash or lineDashOffset see bug

IE and Edge does not support globalAlpha for drawImage of SVG graphics. see bug see testcase
