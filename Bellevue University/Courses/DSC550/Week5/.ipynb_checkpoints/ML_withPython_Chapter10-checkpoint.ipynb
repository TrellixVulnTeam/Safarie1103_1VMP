    "##Chapter 10. Dimensionality Reduction Using Feature Selection \n",
    "\n",
    "### 10.0 Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "In Chapter 9, we discussed how to reduce the dimensionality of our feature matrix by creating new features with (ideally) similar ability to train quality models but with significantly fewer dimensions. This is called feature extraction. In this chapter we will cover an alternative approach: selecting high-quality, informative features and dropping less useful features. This is called feature selection.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are three types of feature selection methods: filter, wrapper, and embedded. Filter methods select the best features by examining their statistical properties. Wrapper methods use trial and error to find the subset of features that produce models with the highest quality predictions. Finally, embedded methods select the best feature subset as part or as an extension of a learning algorithm’s training process.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ideally, we’d describe all three methods in this chapter. However, since embedded methods are closely intertwined with specific learning algorithms, they are difficult to explain prior to a deeper dive into the algorithms themselves. Therefore, in this chapter we cover only filter and wrapper feature selection methods, leaving the discussion of particular embedded methods until the chapters where those learning algorithms are discussed in depth. \n",

    "Variance thresholding (VT) is one of the most basic approaches to feature selection. It is motivated by the idea that features with low variance are likely less interesting (and useful) than features with high variance. VT first calculates the variance of each feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "operatorname Var(x) = \\frac{1}{n}\\sum_{i=1}^n \\left(x_i - \\mu\\right)^2 \\\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where x is the feature vector, xi is an individual feature value, and μ is that feature’s mean value. Next, it drops all features whose variance does not meet that threshold. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are two things to keep in mind when employing VT. First, the variance is not centered; that is, it is in the squared unit of the feature itself. Therefore, the VT will not work when feature sets contain different units (e.g., one feature is in years while a different feature is in dollars). Second, the variance threshold is selected manually, so we have to use our own judgment for a good value to select (or use a model selection technique described in Chapter 12). We can see the variance for each feature using variances_:\n",

    "Chi-square statistics examines the independence of two categorical vectors. That is, the statistic is the difference between the observed number of observations in each class of a categorical feature and what we would expect if that feature was independent (i.e., no relationship) with the target vector:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation*}\n",
    "\\chi^2 =  \\sum_{i=1}^n \\frac{\\left(O_i - E_i\\right)^2}{E_i}\\\n",
    "\\end{equation*}\n",
    "\n",
    "where Oi is the number of observations in class i and Ei is the number of observations in class i we would expect if there is no relationship between the feature and target vector.\n",
    "\n",
    "A chi-squared statistic is a single number that tells you how much difference exists between your observed counts and the counts you would expect if there were no relationship at all in the population. By calculating the chi-squared statistic between a feature and the target vector, we obtain a measurement of the independence between the two. If the target is independent of the feature variable, then it is irrelevant for our purposes because it contains no information we can use for classification. On the other hand, if the two features are highly dependent, they likely are very informative for training our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use chi-squared in feature selection, we calculate the chi-squared statistic between each feature and the target vector, then select the features with the best chi-square statistics. In scikit-learn, we can use SelectKBest to select the features with the best statistics. The parameter k determines the number of features we want to keep. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note that chi-square statistics can only be calculated between two categorical vectors. For this reason, chi-squared for feature selection requires that both the target vector and the features are categorical. However, if we have a numerical feature we can use the chi-squared technique by first transforming the quantitative feature into a categorical feature. Finally, to use our chi-squared approach, all values need to be non-negative. \n",
    "\n",
    "Alternatively, if we have a numerical feature we can use f_classif to calculate the ANOVA F-value statistic with each feature and the target vector. F-value scores examine if, when we group the numerical feature by the target vector, the means for each group are significantly different. For example, if we had a binary target vector, gender, and a quantitative feature, test scores, the F-value score would tell us if the mean test score for men is different than the mean test score for women. If it is not, then test score doesn’t help us predict gender and therefore the feature is irrelevant.\n"

    "This is likely the most advanced recipe in this book up to this point, combining a number of topics we have yet to address in detail. However, the intuition is straightforward enough that we can address it here rather than holding off until a later chapter. The idea behind RFE is to train a model that contains some parameters (also called weights or coefficients) like linear regression or support vector machines repeatedly. The first time we train the model, we include all the features. Then, we find the feature with the smallest parameter (notice that this assumes the features are either rescaled or standardized), meaning it is less important, and remove the feature from the feature set.\n",
    "\n",
    "The obvious question then is: how many features should we keep? We can (hypothetically) repeat this loop until we only have one feature left. A better approach requires that we include a new concept called cross-validation (CV). We will discuss cross-validation in detail in the next chapter, but here is the general idea. \n",
    "\n",
    "Given data containing 1) a target we want to predict and 2) a feature matrix, first we split the data into two groups: a training set and a test set. Second, we train our model using the training set. Third, we pretend that we do not know the target of the test set, and apply our model to the test set’s features in order to predict the values of the test set. Finally, we compare our predicted target values with the true target values to evaluate our model.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use CV to find the optimum number of features to keep during RFE. Specifically, in RFE with CV after every iteration, we use cross-validation to evaluate our model. If CV shows that our model improved after we eliminated a feature, then we continue on to the next loop. However, if CV shows that our model got worse after we eliminated a feature, we put that feature back into the feature set and select those features as the best. \n",
    "\n",
    "In scikit-learn, RFE with CV is implemented using RFECV and contains a number of important parameters. The estimator parameter determines the type of model we want to train (e.g., linear regression). The step regression sets the number or proportion of features to drop during each loop. The scoring parameter sets the metric of quality we use to evaluate our model during cross-validation. \n",
