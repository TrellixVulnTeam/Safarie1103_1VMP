    "## Chapter 9. Dimensionality Reduction Using Feature Extraction\n",
    "### 9.0 Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to have access to thousands and even hundreds of thousands of features. For example, in Chapter 8 we transformed a 256 × 256–pixel color image into 196,608 features. Furthermore, because each of these pixels can take one of 256 possible values, there ends up being 256196608 different configurations our observation can take. This is problematic because we will practically never be able to collect enough observations to cover even a small fraction of those configurations and our learning algorithms do not have enough data to operate correctly. Fortunately, not all features are created equal and the goal of feature extraction for dimensionality reduction is to transform our set of features, poriginal, such that we end up with a new set, pnew, where poriginal > pnew, while still keeping much of the underlying information. Put another way, we reduce the number of features with only a small loss in our data’s ability to generate high-quality predictions. In this chapter, we will cover a number of feature extraction techniques to do just this. One downside of the feature extraction techniques we discuss is that the new features we generate will not be interpretable by humans. They will contain as much or nearly as much ability to train our models, but will appear to the human eye as a collection of random numbers. If we wanted to maintain our ability to interpret our models, dimensionality reduction through feature selection is a better option. "
