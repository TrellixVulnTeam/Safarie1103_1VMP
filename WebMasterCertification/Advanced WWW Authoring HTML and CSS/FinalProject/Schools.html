        <h1>Welcome to the Canyon Lake Schools</h1>
        <p>Local schools are growing as the community grows. Please visit the home pages below to get more information.</p>
               <p>Canyon Lake High School is a public high school located in the Canyon Lake census-designated place in unincoprorated Comal County, Texas (USA), near Fischer Texas. It is part of the Comal Independent School District and is one of three high schools in the district. Canyon Lake High School is zoned for students who live primarily in the northwestern Comal County area, including most of the Canyon Lake CDP.</p>

          <p>Rebecca Creek Elementary opened in the Fall of 2002 as part of Comal Independent School District.  Rebecca Creek Elementary is named after the original Rebecca Creek School that dates back to 1882 and was located on the same ranch as our new school. The original Rebecca Creek School was named for the community which took its name from the creek, Rebecca Creek. The creek is said to have been named after Rebecca Sterling who married landowner Jacob de Cordova, the founder of Waco in the 1840’s. Another version of the story is that the creek was named after an Indian princess, Rebecca, who lived near the creek and also died there.</p>

               <p>Mt. Valley School had its beginning as the Jacob’s Creek School in 1867, long before Comal ISD was established in 1956. Oscar Friedrich gave land “in the corner of the Guadalupe River and the so-called Jacob’s Creek, for a school and residence and field for the teacher.” As settlers moved further up the river, and to have the school centrally located, John Marshall in 1874 conveyed land in Sattler to Fritz Krause, Fritz Pantermuehl and Joachim Pantermuehl and the name of the school was changed to Mt. Valley School. In the 1950s it was the last school known as a one-teacher school in the county.</p>

           <p>Smithson Valley High School opened in the fall of 1976 in rural central Comal County.  Prior to its opening, students from the area were bussed to Canyon High School.  As a “bicentennial” school, the colors were chosen as those of the flag:  red, white, and blue.</p>
