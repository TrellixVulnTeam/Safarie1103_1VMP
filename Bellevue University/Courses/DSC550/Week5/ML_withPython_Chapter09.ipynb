    "## Chapter 9. Dimensionality Reduction Using Feature Extraction\n",
    "### 9.0 Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "It is common to have access to thousands and even hundreds of thousands of features. For example, in Chapter 8 we transformed a 256 × 256–pixel color image into 196,608 features. Furthermore, because each of these pixels can take one of 256 possible values, there ends up being 256196608 different configurations our observation can take. This is problematic because we will practically never be able to collect enough observations to cover even a small fraction of those configurations and our learning algorithms do not have enough data to operate correctly. Fortunately, not all features are created equal and the goal of feature extraction for dimensionality reduction is to transform our set of features, poriginal, such that we end up with a new set, pnew, where poriginal > pnew, while still keeping much of the underlying information. Put another way, we reduce the number of features with only a small loss in our data’s ability to generate high-quality predictions. In this chapter, we will cover a number of feature extraction techniques to do just this. One downside of the feature extraction techniques we discuss is that the new features we generate will not be interpretable by humans. They will contain as much or nearly as much ability to train our models, but will appear to the human eye as a collection of random numbers. If we wanted to maintain our ability to interpret our models, dimensionality reduction through feature selection is a better option. "

    "Principal component analysis (PCA) is a popular linear dimensionality reduction technique. PCA projects observations onto the (hopefully fewer) principal components of the feature matrix that retain the most variance. PCA is an unsupervised technique, meaning that it does not use the information from the target vector and instead only considers the feature matrix. For a mathematical description of how PCA works, see the external resources listed at the end of this recipe. However, we can understand the intuition behind PCA using a simple example. In the following figure, our data contains two features, x1 and x2. Looking at the visualization, it should be clear that observations are spread out like a cigar, with a lot of length and very little height. More specifically, we can say that the variance of the “length” is significantly greater than the “height.” Instead of length and height, we refer to the “directions” with the most variance as the first principal component and the “direction” with the second-most variance as the second principal component (and so on). If we wanted to reduce our features, one strategy would be to project all observations in our 2D space onto the 1D\n"
