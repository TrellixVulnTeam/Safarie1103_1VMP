# Desc:
# This program works as a cash register. The user is prompted to enter a dollar amount
# for an item. The program keeps a tally of the total amount as user enters each value.
# Once completed, the program displays the total of values as well as number of values
# entered.
# Usage:
# Execute this program from the command line by entering the program name Safari_DSC510_ObjectOrientedCashRegister
