# Desc:
#	This program will perform various calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and average calculation)
#	This program will contain a variety of loops and functions.
#	The program will add, subtract, multiply, divide two numbers and provide the average of multiple numbers input by the user.
#	Define a function named performCalculation which takes one parameter. The parameter will be the operation being performed (+, -, *, /).
#	This function will perform the given prompt the user for two numbers then perform the expected operation depending on the parameter that's passed into the function.
#	This function will print the calculated value for the end user.
#	Define a function named calculateAverage which takes no parameters.
#	This function will ask the user how many numbers they wish to input.
#	This function will use the number of times to run the program within a for loop in order to calculate the total and average.
#	This function will print the calculated average.
#	This program will have a main section which contains a while loop. The while loop will be used to allow the user to run the program until they enter a value which ends the loop.
#	The main program should prompt the user for the operation they wish to perform.
#	The main program should evaluate the entered data using if statements.
#	The main program should call the necessary function to perform the calculation.
# Usage: Provide input when prompted.
